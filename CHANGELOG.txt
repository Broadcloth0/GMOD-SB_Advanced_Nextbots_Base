1. NEW FEATURES

1.1. Node Graph module
1.1.1. Added SBNodeGraphPathFollower:PriorSegment and SBNodeGraphPathFollower:NextSegment.
1.1.2. Added sb_anb_nodegraph_trivialcheck. Enables/disables trivial path checking.
1.1.3. Added sb_anb_nodegraph_trivialcheck_debug. Shows trivial check traces using debug overlay.
1.1.4. Added support for using ladders (using CAP_MOVE_CLIMB link movetype as ladder).

1.2. Nextbot base
1.2.1. Added NEXTBOT:LocomotionUpdate where velocity and other locomotion stuff should be called.

2.1.3. Set `how` parameter of SBNodeGraphPathFollower segments to related GO_* enum.
2.1.4. Better jumping support while moving along the path.
2.1.5. Disabled map versions mismatch check between map and node graph file while loading graph.
2.1.6. Added `visiblepos` and `mask` optional parameters to GetNearestNode function for visibility checking.

2.2. Nextbot base

2.2.12. Using different ACTs for range and reload gestures depending on crouching state.

2.3. Nextbot soldier base
2.3.1. Increase NEXTBOT.PathGoalToleranceFinal from 50 to 70.
2.3.2. Decrease range need to be far from leader to start following him from 300 to 100.
2.3.3. Make bots capable to using ladders.
2.3.4. Dont trying to step back when we are touched by enemy.

3. FIXES

3.1. Node Graph module
3.1.1. Fixed SBNodeGraphNode links related functions returns current node instead of destination node due to link nature.
3.1.2. Fixed SBNodeGraphPathFollower:Draw draws LADDER_UP segment as LADDER_DOWN and vice vesta.

3.2. Nextbot base
3.2.1. Emit engine weapon lua analogs sounds from original weapon, not nextbot inself.
3.2.2. Fixed engine weapon lua analogs bullet tracer origin, now it starts from weapon, not nextbot head.
3.2.3. Make crossbow lua analog bolts not solid for few frames to make sure it will not hit the owner.
3.2.4. Prevent smg1 lua analog grenades from exploding for few frames to make sure it will not hit the owner.

3.3. Nextbot soldier base
3.3.1. Make bots still shooting at enemy when line of sight blocked with other enemy.
